### What is the problem you’re trying to solve?
Build a semi-decenralized, distributed marketplace for producers to sell their surplus of electricity and consumers to purchase at the best market rate.

### Why is this problem important to solve?
Today electricity generated by large grids that goes unused is wasted. Storing this surplus capacity and selling during peak hours when production capacity is strained can reduce cost to the consumers. This approach is similar to elastic computing first introduced by AWS. To enable elastic electricity requires lower cost, higher capacity storage. The innovative breakthroughs in silicon-anode batteries will make this possible. 

Green alternative producers of electricity (solar, wind, etc) aren’t able to sell their surplus. 	Instead of forcing every alternative producer to store their surplus by purchasing batteries, by enabling 2-way transmission they can resell their surplus. 

The cumulative effect will reduce the cost of electricity by optimizing production and usage.

### Why now?
EV has ushered breakthroughs in green energy and battery technology. However, the electric grid remains in the past. Pricing is set by the grid because it’s the only producer. To fully leverage on these innovations, the grid needs to be updated. Instead of a single producer who holds a monopoly on pricing, we envision micro-grids for each community where pricing is dynamic and consumers benefit from optimized pricing. The micro-grid serves as a market maker and order book matching multiple electricity producers with consumers. 
Now is the time to start building out this vision in anticipation of these innovations coming together.

### Why is blockchain necessary?
To reduce consumption fraud, each electrical meter is mapped to a wallet address. Every kWatt consumed/produced is traceable by a transaction signed by the meter’s private key and committed in the permissioned micro-grid blockchain. Consumption cost is easily settled automatically because it is in the blockchain’s ledger.
